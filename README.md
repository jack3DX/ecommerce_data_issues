# E-commerce data issues

## Background

There's an Amazon-like organization who have a website for its marketplace and a system for the sales and logistics parts of every online interaction.

There are two main pages for this scenario:
- My orders (where the customers may see the status of their orders)
- Control panel (where the top management and vendors may follow the revenue metrics)

## The problems

1 - The catalog: there's been a lot of customer complaints regarding the catalog and the recommendation system, due to its randomness. Most of the recommended products do not represent what the customer would like to see. As a consequence, they're spending too much time looking for what they want. The search bar is also not good, taking too much time to show products that are being typed in the user session.

2 - My orders page: there are complaints over this page because the customers can't see the status of their purchases. As a consequence, a lot of customers cancel their orders.

3 - Control panel: the top management and vendors would like to see a real-time update basis on the control panel. It would help them to take action as soon as possible.

## The challenge

The challenge is to present a solution that recommends products efficiently, a fast search bar, a good and clear vision of the My Orders page and the purchases' data, and a real-time control panel.

It should also contemplate reduced downtime (or no downtime, if possible), be resilient, have workarounds for failure scenarios, and above all, make the minimum changes to the current application.
